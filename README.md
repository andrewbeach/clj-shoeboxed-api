# shoeboxed-api

A Clojure library wrapping the Shoeboxed v2 HTTP API. This is currently a hobby project, so there is no guarantee of api stability at this time. 

All endpoints returning data do so in the form of Clojure collections; when an HTTP endpoint returns a JSON response, you can expect a keywordized Clojure hash map. 

Due to the power of Clojure collections, combined with Clojure's repl-driven development process, I will claim this is the easiest way available to explore the Shoeboxed API. The examples/ directory contains real world demonstrations of this. 

Since this is a hobby project, I will keep version numbers below 1.0.0 for the time being. If this becomes a working clojar, I will bump the version over 1.0.0 and promise api stability.

This is my first attempt at wrapping an http api in clojure, so please let me know if there are "best practices" that I'm not following here :-)

## Usage

The typical flow using this library is to: 

1. redirect your user to the Shoeboxed authentication uri (:auth-uri shoeboxed-api.config/sbx)
2. get the authorization_code from the query params when the user is redirected to (:redirect-uri **your-client**)
3. get an access token from shoeboxed-api.auth/get-access-token, given your client and authorization-code
4. make api calls using the client and access-token

Currently, the refresh token must be used manually, and there is no automated refresh. TODO: automate token refreshing when access token is expired.

To experiment with this in a clojure repl, you will need to manually call the Shoeboxed API oauth authentication endpoint in a browser (:auth-uri shoeboxed-api.config/sbx), login as a real Shoeboxed user, and record the authorization code in the callback's query parameters. You can then use that code in the repl to gain an access token and make api calls. 

### Config

The config namespace contains default Shoeboxed API uri information, as well as helpers for building a Shoeboxed API client. 

config/sbx is always constant, as it defined the various uris encountered when interacting with the Shoeboxed API. 

config/sample-client shows the shape of a Shoeboxed API client. 

You will need to access your Shoeboxed account settings to create your own Shoeboxed API Application and redirect uri; after creating that, you will be given a client id and secret.

Currently, this library assumes that you will manually redirect your user to Shoeboxed's authentication uri, and that you can then get the authorization-code from the callback response. 

### OAuth

The authorization namespace has helper functions for obtaining an API access token after having the user authenticate (and thus provide an authentication code). 

### API Endpoints

The api namespace contains functions for each Shoeboxed api endpoint, and they are named to match the HTTP API endpoints. 

For example, all "/account/{account_id}/xxx" HTTP endpoints have corresponding functions "<verb>-account-xxx" that take the account id as a parameter, along with an access token and options. 

The options are added directly to the query params for a GET request. 

So, GET "/account/{account_id}/categories?foo=bar" becomes "(get-account-categories access-token account-id {:foo "bar"})".

The order of arguments of these functions is intentional: 

- the first argument is always the access-token so that the functions can be partially applied for a given user's authentication context.
- the second argument, for qualified routes like "accounts/{account_id}", is that qualification variable (account id in this case), so that functions could be further applied for the local account context.
- an options parameter can be passed in containing key-value pairs matching the Shoeboxed API options for that endpoint. Options will be merged into pre-defined options in many cases. Ex: get-account-receipts merges its options parameter with {:type "receipts"}, so that, in addition to the given options, the result is also limited to receipts.

All of these functions return the body of the endpoint's response. For those endpoints that return a more complex body, the relevant part will be returned. 

For example, "account/*/documents" endpoints will return the :documents part of the body response, rather than the raw body (which contains other metadata, like a document count). 

The function get-endpoint can always be used directly to get any endpoint and the raw response if that additional information is desired; I don't see this as a common usecase, so contact me if you disagree, and I can rethink the design. 

### Receipt

The receipt namespace includes functions for working with Shoeboxed receipts.
